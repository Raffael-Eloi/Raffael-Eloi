🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m Raffael Eloi, a Software Engineer and Software Architect from Minas Gerais, Brazil.

I love building systems that are not only functional, but scalable, maintainable, and enjoyable to work on. 

I care a lot about clean code, SOLID principles, DDD, and architecture approaches like microservices, modular monoliths, and serverless.

With a background in Computer Science and a Master’s in Software Architecture, I enjoy connecting theory to real-world engineering — designing solutions that hold up as systems grow and evolve.

📚 What I Do

Build backend and frontend systems.

Design APIs (REST, serverless) and pipelines.

Create infrastructure through code — Terraform, CI/CD, automation, and cloud-native setups.

Work with TDD and BDD because I believe in the practice and it's how I like to build software.

Explore DevOps practices, Kubernetes, microservices patterns, and everything that helps software scale smoothly.

Write about software architecture, clean code, and real dev challenges — both in English and Portuguese.

🔧 Tech & Tools I Use Often 

C# / .NET · TypeScript · Terraform · Azure · Serverless · Kubernetes · REST / APIs · Design Patterns · SOLID · DDD · TDD / BDD · CI/CD · Clean Architecture · Microservices / Modular Monolith

📂 What You’ll Find Here

My GitHub is a mix of personal, professional, and academic projects, including:
- Frontend services
- Backend services and API designs
- Infrastructure-as-code projects and automated pipelines
- Experiments with architecture, cloud technologies, and system design

If something catches your eye, feel free to explore, star, or reach out — I'm always open to collaborations and conversations.

🌱 Off the keyboard

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, spending time disconnected from social media (I don’t use it), and continuously studying and reflecting on software engineering and architecture.

I value moments of quiet and connection with nature, which often inspire me to write and share thoughts about technology, learning, and the craft of software development.
