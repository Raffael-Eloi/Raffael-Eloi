🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m Raffael Eloi, a Software Engineer and Software Architect (MSc) from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

I love building systems that are not only functional, but scalable, maintainable, and enjoyable to work on. I care a lot about clean code, SOLID principles, DDD, and modern architecture approaches like microservices, modular monoliths, and serverless.

With a background in Computer Science and a Master’s in Software Architecture, I enjoy connecting theory to real-world engineering — designing solutions that hold up as systems grow and evolve.

📚 What I Do

Build backend systems with .NET / C#, and occasionally TypeScript when the project calls for it.

Design APIs (REST, serverless), event flows, and data-processing pipelines.

Create infrastructure through code — Terraform, CI/CD, automation, and cloud-native setups.

Work with TDD and BDD because I believe reliable software should be the default, not an afterthought
.
Explore DevOps practices, Kubernetes, microservices patterns, and everything that helps software scale smoothly.

Write about software architecture, clean code, and real dev challenges — both in English and Portuguese.
